            <h3 class="top-header">reimagining it</h3>
            <h2>why redesign OliveOne?</h2>
            <p>After I created my first version of OliveOne, I was very proud of it as it was my first attempt at app prototyping. However, as I continued working on other projects and seeking advice from other designers, I realized that my
              design
              could be improved. As a result, I decided to reimagine OliveOne and design it using my new skills and design style!</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>the problem</h3>
          <h2>finding the all-in-one tool.</h2>
          <p>One day, I was helping my mom write out our grocery list for the week. We wrote our list on a random sticky note we found as we went through the weekly flyers. By the time we arrived at the store later that day, we realized that we had
            forgotten our list at home. Not to mention, we had spent almost a whole hour writing our list and our counter was covered in flyers. That is when I decided to design OliveOne.</p>
          <p>After conducting user research, I realized that we were not the only ones facing this problem! Many respondents shared how they hate flipping back and forth between their notepad and flyers. Instead, they'd like to see a centralized app
            that showed all available grocery products within their area.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>my solution</h3>
          <h2>meet OliveOne.</h2>
          <p>OliveOne is free mobile organizational tool that simplifies the grocery shopping experiences. Users can create digital grocery lists where they can add real products and their prices, compare products across multiple brands and
            store, and
            collaborate with others.</p>

        <h3>reflection</h3>
        <h2>here's what i learned.</h2>
        <p>As this was my first time designing an app, I learned a lot about the UX design process and how important it is! When I first came up with the idea for OliveOne, I only envisioned the final product, and I glossed over many vital
          steps
          like user and market research and wireframing. However, after doing more research and studying other case studies, I realized that there was so much more to UX design.</p>
        <p>I began to conduct surveys to better understand my audience and I compared my design to other competitors. I also made many revisions to the final app as I realized that other users will interpret OliveOne differently from how I
          did.</p>
        <p>After finishing my first prototype, I realized that my original design was outdated and was not reflective of my design skills. Deciding if I should redesign my app was a difficult choice as I spent so much time working on the first version
          of it. However, I knew that this app idea had a lot of potential and I wanted to convey it in the best possible way!</p>
        <br>
        <div class="skills">
          <p><strong>Skills I Acquired:</strong> User/ Market Research, SWOT Analysis, User Personas & Flows, Wireframing (Balsamiq), Low & High-Fidelity Prototyping (Figma), Usability Scripts & Tests, Style Guides, Crtical Thinking</p>

            <p><strong>Exploring high-touch zones.</strong></p>
            <p>I want to conduct more research that analyzes what elements stand out most to others. I want to learn how to use a software called VisionEyes to see what areas users are most drawn to. This will allow me to place emphasis on more
              important features.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="steps-col steps-col-2">
            <p><strong>Continue to design!</strong></p>
            <p>I hope to complete more independent and collaborative projects like this in the future! I learned so much from this experience and can't wait to see what I will do next!</p>
          </div>
          <div class="steps-col steps-col-3">
            <p><strong>Refine this design.</strong></p>
            <p>After completing this project, I realized that there are many ways for me to improve the functionality and visual design of my app. I will continue to gather feedback on my app to see how I can
              improve!</p>
          </div>
          <div class="steps-col steps-col-4">
            <p><strong>Learn more.</strong></p>
            <p>In the future, I will reach out to other UX designers to receive advice and learn more about their personal design process. I also want to learn more about what it takes to be a
              UX designer and what it's like being a professional UX designer.</p>
